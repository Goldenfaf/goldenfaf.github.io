var personalStatement = " Hello.  My name is Emily and I have been recognized as one of the best pitchers in the country by USA Softball HPP (top 3), Extra Innings (#2 West), LineDriveMedia (top 10), and others.  I aspire to continue to be part of this select group of talented pitchers through elite determination, work ethic, and competitiveness.  I have been fortunate enough to compete on nationally recognized teams since the age of 9 and have competed against the best teams and best pitchers across the nation.  I am tough and tournament-tested as I have won 5 National Championships (3x PGF, Sparkler, IDT) and have pitched in 4 National Finals games (3-0, twice on TV).  I love softball, baking, and hanging out with my friends and I am ranked near the top of my class with a 4.8 GPA. ";
